# RestrictedProcess.NET
A small .NET library containing restricted process executor which can be used to run Windows programs with restricted rights. RestrictedProcess.NET can also limit the time and the memory of a running process.

#### History

From 2013 till 2015 the `RestrictedProcess` library was part of other project of mine called [Open Judge System](https://github.com/NikolayIT/OpenJudgeSystem).

Since the code was useful there I thought it may be useful in other projects as well. So I am moving it into separate repository and give it right to be independent ;)
